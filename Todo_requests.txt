[x] - Check normalization option
- GUI: Statistical tests
- Plot function (GUI: Setting plot parameters in plot func), automatic plot.
[x] - GUI: Add folder tree automatically
- Debug "add folder tree": 1st id for groups, 2nd id for subs. Right now, no counting for 2nd id?!
- GUI: Start with "Group" only(?)
[x] - Add "Sets" to store various analysis "of the same"
[x] - Look up different sets to see if calculations have been done before
- Add "prüfsumme" to check if update is necessary.
- GUI: Tidy save/load: read and save all parameters/settings from/to input_data 
- Help: F1 for all functions
- Help: (re-)write manual
- GUI: "Interactive" help (? tooltips)
- GUI: "Pre-Defined" analysis (PNAS scripts?)
- Add functions (.................................)
[x] - GUI: Add statistics "pool"
- GUI: Store/show previous options
- Move "normalization" from options to plot_mode
- GUI: "Optiontree": Only show options if other options are set beforehand (e.g., kds bandwidth only for method "ksdensity").
- Input txt-file
- (GUI) Check format of input trajectory 
[x] - GUI: Plot_mode simplify choose indices
- GUI: Plot hold/new figure for maps, subfigs(?)
[x] - GUI: Plot_mode, choose rows.
- GUI: Advanced options for loadData
- GUI/not-GUI option for not overlapping bins for time 
- GUI/not-GUI: Results (Distr) only for distributions
- Internal funcinfo works for one trial only! E.g., difficult to compare different group sizes. 
- Implement configuration with autocombs+hist+xaxis=days,... in order to caclulate P(# nbs) vs. days etc.
[x] - GUI: Keep count of number of sets for each function (right now, if one function has 5 sets, 5 (maybe empty) sets will show up for every function)
- GUI: Option Default/Reset button.
- GUI: Option table: Inf? (e.g., timeintervals cannot be set to "Inf" once changed)
- GUI: Trajectory table clear!
- GUI: Close UI closes all figures
- GUI: Sets corrsponding to actual figure are highlighted. Incompatible sets are "un-enabled". "Set"-Buttons are like push-buttons: When pressed again, data is removed from figure. 
- GUI: Plot: Recover std+sem handles after openfig.
- GUI/all: clear function results.(?)
- GUI/all: Remove/deal with figures of deleted sets
- GUI: "Script mode": choose all parameters and analyses, press button and run!
- Distance swauam
- versus frames
- preprocessing protocol
- length scale
- !!! Territories/heatmaps
- Sets mit namen
